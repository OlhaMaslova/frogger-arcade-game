﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Frog-arcade-game===============================This is my latest (third) project in my Front-End Nanodegree program at Udacity. The idea of it is to use JavaScript object-oriented features to create an arcade game functionality. I was provided with the game engine (engine.js), most of the visual assets as well as image loading utility (resources.js).[Click here](https://olhamaslova.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) if you want to try the game out yourself. Game Instructions===============================1.
